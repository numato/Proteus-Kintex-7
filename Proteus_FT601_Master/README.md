                   |___  Bitstreams:  This folder contains all the required files to program the board and observe the output. Run the "run_me.bat" file (double click). 
                   |                      This will program the board and also run the ft600-245-sync-fifo-loopback.exe file. You can now observe the data being transferred.
                   |                     (NOTE: You might need to modify the path of "xsct.bat" used in the "run_me.bat" file to the actual path of "xsct.bat" as in your PC.)

                   |               generate the bit file and also Verilog file, XDC file etc required to create Vivado project. To check the output the bit file generated by PyCharm
                   |               can also be used and also the bitstreams generated by Vivado. The required files for creating Vivado project (XDC and V file) are already present in the
